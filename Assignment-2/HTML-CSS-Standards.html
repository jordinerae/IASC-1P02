    <h1 id="Top">Welcome to my HTML+CSS Standards Assignment!</h1>
    <div id="Button"><a href="#Top">Top of Page</a></div>
    <p>
      Feel free to look at some of my previous work in this class
      <a href="https://github.com/jordinerae/IASC-1P02">here</a>. And if you're
      interested, <a href="HTML-CSS-Standards_Style.css">here's</a> the
      stylesheet for this assignment.
    </p>
    <div class="wrapper">

        <h3>
          Here are some things I've learned in this class:
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>relative and absolute links in html</li>
          <li>lists, both ordered and unordered</li>
          <li>divs and how to use them for pretty much anything</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="orderedList">
        <h3>My favourite things to play with in CSS are:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>borders</li>
          <li>fixed position</li>
          <li>background colours</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h4>The following images are shown using two methods.</h4>
    <p>
      The picture of my dog is shown using a relative file path, and it's coming
      from the same folder that my first assignment is in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next picture is one that I found on Google and is shown using an
      absolute link. It's also what I think I should get on this assignment.

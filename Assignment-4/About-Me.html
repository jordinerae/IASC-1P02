    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>School</h3>
      <p>
        I am a fourth year Dramatic Arts student at Brock University, and I'm
        set to graduate in June 2020! I mainly focus in production courses
        because I'm hoping to work as a stage manager after graduation. I've
        already stage managed 2 full productions and 1 staged reading here at
        the school. You can see more of my work on my resume page (I'm available
        for hire starting May 2020!)

      <h3>Interests</h3>
      <p>
        In the last couple of years I've been getting more into playing video
        games. I mainly play PC games but sometimes I'll change it up with some
        PS4, 3DS, and even some mobile games if I'm laying in bed looking for
        something to pass the time. I also really like dogs. A lot of my time at
        home is spent taking care of my dog, going on walks with her, or taking
        her to the dog park. After she's all tired out, she sits by me on the
        couch while I play video games.

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p>
        My main goal after graduation is to be able to support myself through
        just stage management, which is a pretty lofty thing in itself. I'd also
        love to have a nice house with a big backyard and huge windows so I can
        always be close to the outdoors (but still be able to stay in when it's
        too cold outside). The thing about theatre is that it's not really a
        trusty way to pay the bills, so one of my other goals is to stick with
        programming and keep it fun for myself (and maybe I'll be able to make
        some money off it on the side).
